    "quote": "The remarkable thing is, we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past. we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent of how I react it. And so it'is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes.",
